# Calculator GUI using Tkinter

This is a simple calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. The calculator provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons for numeric input, arithmetic operations, and a display to show the result.


# Features

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Buttons for digits from 0 to 9 allow numeric input.
A "C" button clears the current display.
The "=" button evaluates the expression and displays the result.
In case of invalid expressions or errors during evaluation, the display will show "Error."


# Usage
* Launch the calculator application.
* Click the digit buttons to enter the desired numbers for the calculation.
* Click the arithmetic operation buttons to choose the desired operation.
* To perform the calculation, click the "=" button.
* To clear the current input, click the "C" button.


# Important Note
* The calculator uses the Python eval() function to evaluate the expressions. Although convenient, using eval() may be insecure when dealing with user inputs, as it could lead to code injection vulnerabilities. This implementation is intended for educational purposes and simple calculations with trusted inputs. For a more robust and secure calculator, additional input validation and parsing logic would be required.


# Acknowledgments
The calculator GUI was built using the Tkinter library, which is the standard GUI toolkit for Python.

Feel free to modify and enhance this calculator application to suit your needs!

The above code is a simple calculator application implemented using Python's Tkinter library. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations and a graphical user interface to input expressions and display results. Before running the code, ensure you have Python 3.x and Tkinter installed on your system.

The calculator GUI consists of buttons for digits 0 to 9, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), an equal (=) button to calculate the result, and a "C" button to clear the current input. When you click the buttons, it updates the display to show the expression. Clicking the "=" button evaluates the expression and displays the result in the calculator's display.

One important thing to note is that the code uses Python's eval() function to evaluate the expressions. While eval() is convenient, it can be a security risk when dealing with user inputs as it may lead to code injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, this implementation is best suited for educational purposes or calculations with trusted inputs. For a more secure calculator, additional input validation and parsing logic would be required.

Overall, this calculator provides a basic example of how to build a graphical calculator application using Tkinter in Python. You can use it as a starting point to create more advanced calculator applications or integrate it into other projects that require simple arithmetic calculations.
